## Written Installation Instructions

The easiest way to install this script into Indesign is:

- Within ```Indesign```, open the ```Scripts Panel```: ``` Window->Utilities->Scripts```
- Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (macOS) the ```User``` folder and choose ```Reveal In Explorer``` (Windows) or ```Reveal In Finder``` (macOS).

- Download the **[BalaramaToUnicode.zip](https://github.com/Gaudiya-Koshan/indesign-balarama-unicode/raw/main/BalaramaToUnicode.zip)** file
- Unzip the file
- Move ```BalaramaToUnicode.jsx``` into the ```Scripts Panel``` folder opened above  and it will be available to use

If, for whatever reason, you want to manually find the location, it should be buried within a network of visible and hidden (by default) folders:

 OS | Scripts Folder Location
|--------------|:-----| 
| macOS |  Users/```[username]```/Library/Preferences/Adobe InDesign/```[version]```/```[language]```/Scripts/Scripts Panel/
| Windows |  Users\\```[username]```\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\InDesign\\```[version]```\\```[language]```\Scripts\Scripts Panel\

## Use

- Load document with Balarama font characters into Indesign
- Open the Scripts Panel
- Look in the ```User``` folder 
- Double click ```BalaramaToUnicode``` (or ```right-click``` then ```Run Script```) 

## Test

There is an example Indesign (2020) file included that just has all 31 Balarama font characters. You can download this file (it's already in the .zip file), open it in Indesign then test the script:
